Mission

It is our mission to solve obstacles by encouraging people to work together through a platform (a social microservice). As a foundation, Tessify.org creates a robust open-source ecosystem together with volunteers. The portal will be the most prominent source of communication and collaboration humankind has ever witnessed.
